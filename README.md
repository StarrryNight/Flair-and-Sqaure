# Flair-and-Sqaure
The original idea was a rogue-like game with a square. The title comes from the first skill move that I made, which involves a stylish dash from the square. And as a stylistically uninspiring artist I just used the Unity presets of, a square (and circles as enemies)

Welp and as you can see the game deviated significantly  from that. I added elements of card games (also inspired by clash royale's elixar system). Special skills of the square were brought into the realms of Magic, MCU (antman), and even warfrane. I also used this project to test out particle effects and more advanced object oriented programming structure. But ultimately it has been a lot of fun writing scripts and coming up with ideas. I'll try to build and publish the game somewhere.

I didnt really organized the files btw
